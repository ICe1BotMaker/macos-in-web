# Macos in Web

The macos-in-web repository is a medium-sized project where you can experience macos on the website.

It will be updated steadily, not neglected.

## How can I experience it?

Anyone can easily access the site and experience macos just by entering this link.

https://macos.r-e.kr/

## How to make this?

I used `html5`, `css3`, and `javascript` on the spot without the planning stage, and used `node.js` for the backend.

The modules used in the backend are typically `fs`, `express`.

This operation did not use `canvas`.

I worked separately into a `taskbar`, a `main`, and a `dock`.

I made the design element by referring to macos a lot.

And for your information, there is a security risk to implement using `fs` module, so we will rework using `localStorage` or other services.
